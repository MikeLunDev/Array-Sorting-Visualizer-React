# Project Title

Array Sorting Visualizer

# Project Description

This is a front end project built using bootstrap and react. The goal of this application was to create animations of the sorting process inside an array. To accomplish that each element in the array is rapresented by a bar that is colorized and swapped simulating what is happening under the hood inside the sorting process. Everything is put toghether with a combination of setTimeout that allows to perceive everything smoothly.
